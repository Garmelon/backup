# backup

My original backup script repo contains private information. This repo contains
copies of a few backup scripts and will only be updated infrequently, if at all.

This repo is only meant for making sharing the scripts easier. Maybe it will be
gobbled up by a "miscellaneous files" repo or land on github pages in the
future, in which case this repo will be deleted. Don't rely on its presence!
